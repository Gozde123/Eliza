# Facilities & Resources

This page lists the infrastructure, tools and resources the team needs to support development, who obtains each one, and where it stands.

"Cloud service from the university" is a weak entry. It does not say what is needed, who requests it, or whether it is ready. A strong entry answers all three: "GPU runtime for experiments, one shared allocation under the university cloud credit. Responsible: the AI developer for infrastructure. Status: access granted on <date>." (illustrative only)

## Resource categories

Cover each category that applies:

| Category | Examples from the template | AI-specific points from the ISO standards |
|---|---|---|
| **Compute & hosting** | GPU access, cloud credits, vector database hosting, deployment environment | Training can need substantial computing power and waiting time [1]. AI systems can consume considerable compute and memory, and GPUs add cost [1]. The runtime environment can differ from the development environment [1]. |
| **APIs & third-party services** | An LLM provider, an embedding service, and any usage/rate limits to plan around | A project can depend on other organizations for infrastructure or capability [1]. |
| **Software & licenses** | Development tools, orchestration frameworks, monitoring/eval tools | — |
| **Data access** | Storage for the corpus, access permissions, special environments for sensitive data | Datasets can be large and are often stored apart from code [1]. Data stores holding sensitive data enlarge the attack surface and need protection [1]. |
| **Physical/logistical needs** | Lab space, shared workstations | — |

Say also *where* each resource runs: on-premise, as a cloud service, or through a third party [2]. A cloud service is a capability offered through cloud computing and used through a defined interface [2].

## Fields

| Field | What it means | Question it answers | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Resource** | The item, named precisely (type, size, provider) | What exactly do we need? | |
| **Description** | What it is used for, where it runs, and any usage or rate limit | Why do we need it, and what limits apply? | [2] |
| **Responsible Person/Team** | Who obtains or provisions it (e.g., requests API credits, sets up cloud accounts, configures shared repositories) | Who makes it happen? | |
| **Status** | Where the item stands now, with a date | Is it ready? | |

Write Status as a short dated fact, such as "requested on <date>" or "access granted on <date>".

## Rules

1. Every category in the table above is either covered or marked as not needed.
2. Every row names a Responsible Person/Team.
3. Every API or third-party service row states its usage or rate limits.
4. Every compute row says what hardware is used and where it runs [2].
5. The deployment environment has its own row.
6. Every data-access row names the storage and the access permissions, and says whether sensitive data needs a special environment [1].
7. Every row has a dated Status.
8. A fixed limit on a resource is also written as a constraint in [Assumptions & Constraints](03-project-canvas_v2/03-assumptions-and-constraints.md).
9. The chance that a resource fluctuates or fails is a risk in [Risks](03-project-canvas_v2/11-risks.md).
10. When work waits for someone else to deliver a resource, that wait is also a row in [Dependencies](03-project-canvas_v2/06-dependencies.md).

## Test to apply to your draft

Could a new team member start work using only this table: knowing what to use, where it runs, whom to ask, and whether it is ready?

## Not this / this

Each row below shows a resource problem that this page would have caught.

| Not this | Rule broken | This (illustrative only) |
|---|---|---|
| The charter names "the cloud service provided by the university" as the project's resource, while the experiment cards report runs on a team member's laptop GPU. | The resource used is not the resource listed (rule 4) | Two compute rows: "Laptop GPU (12 GB VRAM), member-owned, for development runs" and "Cloud GPU under the university credit, for staging and load tests", each with its Responsible person and dated Status. |
| A retrospective notes that API rate limits and latency spikes disrupted response-time tests, and that limited GPU resources forced a mid-sprint move to a paid notebook tier. | Limits not planned in advance (rules 3, 4) | "External data API, free tier: 60 calls per minute; test scripts cache responses." "Notebook GPU, free tier: session limit per day; fine-tuning runs scheduled within it." Plus a constraint for each limit in [Assumptions & Constraints](03-project-canvas_v2/03-assumptions-and-constraints.md). |

Two good practices to copy:

- Recording access as a precondition: "Team members were granted access permissions for the documentation, task-tracking and repository tools."
- Confirming compute before the work that needs it: "GPU or notebook runtime confirmed for fine-tuning."

## Patterns to use if you are stuck

One row each for:

- **Development compute:** hardware, owner, where it runs.
- **Training or experiment compute:** GPU type and allocation; credit or quota.
- **LLM and embedding access:** hosted locally or through an API; rate limits.
- **Vector database:** where it is hosted.
- **Data storage:** location of raw and processed data; who has access.
- **Shared repository and experiment tracking:** who configures them.
- **Deployment environment:** where the MVP runs.

## What doesn't belong here

- **Costs and person-hours** go in [Cost & Funding](03-project-canvas_v2/07-cost-and-funding.md).
- **Fixed limits** (a credit amount, a quota) are constraints in [Assumptions & Constraints](03-project-canvas_v2/03-assumptions-and-constraints.md).
- **A resource failing or fluctuating** is a risk in [Risks](03-project-canvas_v2/11-risks.md).
- **Waiting for an outside party** is a dependency in [Dependencies](03-project-canvas_v2/06-dependencies.md).
- **Every third-party library, tool and model with its version and license** goes in [Software Bill of Materials](10-software-bill-of-materials.md). List here only what the team needs access to.
- **Documentation of the datasets themselves** goes in the [Datasheets](11-datasheets/README.md) pages. List here only storage and access.
